title: Logistics Pipes Quick Start

*"It's been a long time. How have you been?"*

First off, thanks for playing Logistics Pipes.<br>
A lot of changes have been made since the last release of LP in Minecraft 1.7.10. We'll try to explain some of these in this book. Read the next pages, if you'd like to know them.

I hope you already have your Logistics Power Junction set up and crafted your first Basic Logistics Pipes :)<br>
If not, go for it.<br>
You might have recognized that all other types of pipes and modules now need something called a Logistics Programmer.

The Logistics Programmer is an item that wont be used up in any crafting recipes, but you need to set it up first. That is to be done with a Logistics Program Compiler. I know, I know, it sounds complicated. But it really isn't. Craft both of these and a Logistics Disk.

Now you place the Logistics Program Compiler (further just compiler) next to a Logistics Basic Pipe that is - by other pipes or directly - connected to the Power Junction, because the compiler needs power and will take that from the LP network.

The compiler can be used to research new tiers, pipes, modules and upgrades. Insert the Logistics Disk on the top left. Then you are able to unlock different tiers. Let's start with 'Basic'. Researching takes some time, so relax and get some coffee.

After unlocking a tier, you should be able to see the different pipe, module or upgrade names on the right. You can now compile each of these, which takes a shorter amount of time. Compiling makes those programs flashable onto the Logistics Programmer.

To flash a program, simply insert the Logistics Programmer into the top right slot and flash one of those programs onto the programmer. Afterwards you can use this programmer in the crafting of that item. Module programs can be found within the chassis tiers.

You might be asking where the Mk2 and Mk3 pipes and modules are. They are gone, but you can recreate their effects by adding upgrades to your pipes and modules. Those upgrades are named 'Action Speed', 'Item Extraction' or 'ItemStack Extraction'.

To upgrade your modules, you need an upgrade for your chassis pipe called the 'Module Upgrade'. After applying it to your chassis pipe, new slots appear to the right of every inserted module. That's where the upgrades for the module go.

I hope you got a good overview on how to start with this brand-new LP version. While you're at it you can also check out our new Highspeed Tubes. \
***But most importantly: Have fun!***
